<h1> bpRNAStructure</h1>
<p> Project for Hendrix Lab | Oregon State University </p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To use this package clone this directory onto your machine and adding the following code at the beginning of a script using this package:<br>
import sys <br>
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/directory_containing_bpRNAStructure') <br>
  
The Package can then be imported using: <br>
from bpRNAStructure import Structure as ST <br>
OR <br>
import bpRNAStructure.Structure as ST
</p>

<p>In the future this package will be available for download using pip </p>

<h3>About bpRNAStructure</h3>
<p> The bpRNAStructure package is a python package that provides a user friendly mechanism for working with
RNA structure type files in the python programming language. </p>

<h4>Structure Module</h4>
<p>This Module defines the Structure object and includes functionality for parsing the Structure Type file, as well as for accessing all the information stored in it</p>

<h4>StructureComponents Module</h4>
<p>This Module defines classes for all the secondary structures that are characterized in the Structure Type file. These secondary structures include: Stems, Bulges, Hairpins, InnerLoops, MultiLoops, ExternalLoops, PseudoKnots, Ends, and NCBPs. Each class provides specific functionality for accessing the information about each structure, as well as functionality for calculating the energy associated with each structure.</p>

<h3>Turner Parameters</h3>
<p>Source: https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB/turner04/index.html</p>
<p>These are the current set of nearest neighbor parameters for RNA folding compiled by the Turner group. Both free energy changes at 37 ÂºC and enthalpy changes have been estimated, allowing for structure prediction at arbitrary temperature. These parameters are used by the StructureType module to calculate free energy values for the RNA molecules</p>
<p>The TurnerParameters directory contains three subdirectories: parameterTextFiles, scripts, and parameters. The parameterTextFiles are the text file found at the url above and provide the parameter value for RNA folding. The scripts directory contains several python scripts used to parse these parameters into python dictionaries and write them to python files so they can be imported by the StructureType Module. The parameters directory contains the .py files produced by the scripts.</p>
